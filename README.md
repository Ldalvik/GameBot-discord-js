Here is a list of the available games:

### Type
Use the /type command to get a word that you have to type as fast as possible. To ensure latency doesn't affect your score, the ping is subtracted from your reply time.
Play this with friends to see who is the fastest typer.

### Scramble
Use the /scramble command to get a random scrambled word. The first person to unscrambke it gets a point.

### Taboo
Use the /taboo command to get a random word sent to your DMs. You then have to try and explain the word for others to guess. Whoever answers correctly gets a point.

### More to come...
